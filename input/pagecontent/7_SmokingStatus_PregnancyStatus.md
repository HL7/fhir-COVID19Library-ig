#### Tobacco Smoking Status

The Smoking Status profile is used to capture if the patient is a current smoker, former smoker, or never smoked.  The US Core Implementation Guide(IG) has defined a profile for this and can be found at the link below.  This IG will not create another profile for it.  Examples of this profile can also be found in the US Core IG.
